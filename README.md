# Toy Compiler

This was a small weekend project in which I implement a toy compiler that takes Lisp like syntax and compile it into C like syntax
NOTE: This is in no way a production ready compiler it was made purely as a learning excersie and can probably be done much better

## Getting Started

To mess around with the compiler clone the repo and modify to your hearts content

### Prerequisites

All you need to mess with this compiler is go compiler/interpreter(?)

## Cool things you can do
-add more possible tokens

-have the newly genereated code acutally execute

-build a full on programming language
